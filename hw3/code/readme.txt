=== Note === 
All the code below may encounter EOFError due to incomplete server response. Just run the code again and it should work fine.
If encounters sage module not found error, please run the code under "sage -sh" 
=== Instruction ===
code2.py
- Simply run with python3 code2.py 
- Should run fine by telling which problem to solve

code3.py 
- Simply run with python3 code3.py (may need to run under sage -sh)
- Should run fine by telling which problem to solve
- If encounter EOFError, just run the code again

code5.py
- Simply run with python3 code5.py 
- Problem 3 is not implemented, ignore the option

code6.py 
- Simply run with python3 code6.py 
- Problem 3 is just brute force so please ignore it (lol)

=== tl;dr ===
Install necessary packages with requirement.txt and the code should work fine with the following files.
(If failed to run with requirement.txt, please remove the lines for SageMath and run the installation again)

The other files under code/ are files needed for the code to run. 
(Except for ddos.pcapng which is the file for P4 submission, 
 id* and the executables app* are the files for P1 submission)
